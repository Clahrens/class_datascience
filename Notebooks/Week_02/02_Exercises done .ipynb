More precisely, we assumed that the implementation of financial incentives would not affect individuals' morality.

In a field-study in day-care centers, they have shown that the introduction of a fine for parents arriving late to collect their children significantly increased the number of late-coming parents. Even worse, the effect was not reversible: after the fine was removed, no reduction occurred. Similar effects have been observed for environmental policy, suggesting that putting a price on Nature can lead individuals to leave the \"moral sphere\" towards the \"economic sphere\". In our model, this implies a decrease of the degree of morality. \n",
